# Virtual-Arcade-System

Developed a virtual arcade system using C++ as a part of UCSB IEEE's quarterly project series during the winter 2020 quarter. It can play Tetris and Brick Breaker, along with adjusting settings and updating a high scores list.

Thanks to Geffen Cooper for providing the mentoring and information necessary to help develop this code.
